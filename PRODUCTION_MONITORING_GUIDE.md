## üîç Troubleshooting Workflows

### Problem: User Reports Error

1. **Get Session ID**
   - Check error email alert
   - Or ask user to check browser console

2. **Search Logs**
   ```powershell
   Select-String "SESSION-{id}" backend/logs/application-*.log
   ```

3. **Check Timeline**
   - Review all logs from that session
   - Look for errors before user's action

4. **Get Frontend Logs**
   - Ask user to run: `window.sendConsoleLogs()` in browser console
   - Or: `window.downloadConsoleLogs()` to download

### Problem: Enrollments Failing

1. **Check Database Health**
   ```bash
   GET /api/health/database/254
   ```

2. **Review Error Logs**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content backend/logs/error-2025-09-30.log -Tail 100
   ```

3. **Check for Alerts**
   - Check email for database/payment alerts

4. **Test Enrollment Flow**
   - Try test enrollment
   - Check each step (form ‚Üí contract ‚Üí payment)

### Problem: No Emails Being Sent

1. **Check SMTP Settings**
   ```bash
   GET /api/health/detailed
   ```

2. **Review Email Logs**
   ```powershell
   Select-String "email" backend/logs/application-*.log | Select-Object -Last 20
   ```

3. **Test Email System**
   ```bash
   POST /api/health/test-email-alert
   ```

4. **Check Email Alerts**
   - Should receive "Email Service Failure" alert

### Problem: Payment Processor Down

1. **Check Health**
   ```bash
   GET /api/health/detailed
   ```

2. **Review Payment Logs**
   ```powershell
   Select-String "payment|converge|fluidpay" backend/logs/error-*.log
   ```

3. **Test Processors**
   - Check processor status pages
   - Verify API credentials in `.env`

4. **Check for Alerts**
   - Should receive "Payment Processor Down" alert

### Problem: High Error Rate

1. **Count Recent Errors**
   ```powershell
   (Select-String "error" backend/logs/error-2025-09-30.log | 
    Where-Object {$_.Line -match (Get-Date).ToString("HH:")}
   ).Count
   ```

2. **Identify Pattern**
   ```powershell
   Select-String "error" backend/logs/error-2025-09-30.log | 
   Group-Object {$_.Line -replace '.*error: (.*?) \{.*','$1'} | 
   Sort-Object Count -Descending
   ```

3. **Check System Resources**
   ```bash
   GET /api/health/stats
   ```

4. **Review Recent Deployments**
   - Was code recently changed?
   - Check git history

## üìà Monitoring Best Practices

### Daily Checks

**Morning:**
- [ ] Check `/api/health/detailed` - Verify all systems green
- [ ] Review error logs from previous day
- [ ] Check email for any overnight alerts

**During Business Hours:**
- [ ] Monitor error email alerts
- [ ] Check logs if user reports issue
- [ ] Verify enrollment completions in database

**Evening:**
- [ ] Review error count for the day
- [ ] Check system stats (memory, CPU)
- [ ] Verify log rotation working

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Review error trends (are certain errors increasing?)
- [ ] Check disk space usage for logs
- [ ] Test health endpoints
- [ ] Verify email alerts working (send test alert)
- [ ] Review database connection stability

### Monthly Checks

- [ ] Review all alert emails
- [ ] Analyze enrollment success rate
- [ ] Check for outdated logs (should auto-delete)
- [ ] Update monitoring documentation
- [ ] Review and update alert recipients

## üõ†Ô∏è Monitoring Tools Setup

### 1. Set Up URL Monitoring (Recommended)

Use a service like:
- **UptimeRobot** (free) - https://uptimerobot.com
- **Pingdom** - https://pingdom.com
- **StatusCake** - https://statuscake.com

**Configure:**
- Monitor: `https://your-domain/api/health`
- Interval: Every 5 minutes
- Alert if: Response time > 5 seconds OR status != 200
- Alert via: Email/SMS

### 2. Windows Task Scheduler Health Check (Optional)

Create a scheduled task to check health every 15 minutes:

```powershell
# Save as: check-health.ps1
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-domain/api/health/detailed"
if ($response.status -ne "OK") {
    # Send alert or log issue
    Write-EventLog -LogName Application -Source "OnlineEnrollment" `
                   -EntryType Error -EventId 1000 `
                   -Message "Health check failed: $($response | ConvertTo-Json)"
}
```

### 3. Email Filter Rules

Set up email filters to:
- **üî¥ CRITICAL alerts** ‚Üí Send SMS/notification
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning alerts** ‚Üí Flag for review
- **‚úÖ Service restored** ‚Üí Mark as read
