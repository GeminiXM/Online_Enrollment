# Production Deployment Checklist

## üìã Complete Pre-Production Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying to production to ensure everything is properly configured and monitored.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Configuration & Environment

### Environment Variables

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerts Setup

### External Monitoring
- [ ] Set up UptimeRobot or similar service
- [ ] Monitor `https://your-domain/api/health` every 5 minutes
- [ ] Configure alert if response time > 5 seconds
- [ ] Configure alert if status code != 200
- [ ] Add SMS/phone alerts for critical failures
- [ ] Test monitoring service (stop server, verify alert received)

### Email Alerts Configuration
- [ ] Verify error notification emails configured
- [ ] Verify critical alert emails configured
- [ ] Set up email filtering rules:
  - üî¥ CRITICAL alerts ‚Üí SMS/Immediate notification
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors ‚Üí Flag for review
  - ‚úÖ Service restored ‚Üí Archive
- [ ] Test alert email delivery
- [ ] Verify alert emails not going to spam

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log review schedule (daily, weekly)
- [ ] Document how to access logs
- [ ] Train team on log analysis
- [ ] Set up log backup (optional)
