# Files to Remove Before Production

This document categorizes files for cleanup before deploying to production. Files are organized into:
1. **Development/Testing Files** - Used during development but not needed in production
2. **Completely Unused Files** - Not referenced anywhere, safe to delete immediately
3. **Files to Keep** - Important files that must remain

---

## üîß Category 1: Development/Testing Files (Remove for Production)

These files are actively used during development but should be removed or hidden in production.

### Backend - Test/Debug Scripts
```
backend/test-email.js
test-fluidpay-debug.js
```
**Used For:** Manual testing of email and FluidPay functionality  
**Why Remove:** Not needed in production, only for development debugging

### Frontend - Test/Demo HTML Files
```
frontend/public/converge-demo-iframe.html
frontend/public/fluidpay-demo-iframe.html
frontend/public/test-online-enrollment.html
frontend/public/test.html
```
**Used For:** Testing payment processor iframes and enrollment flow  
**Why Remove:** Development testing only, not part of production app

### Backend - PDF Contract Files (Optional)
```
backend/src/contracts/*.pdf (48 files)
```
**Used For:** Sample/test contract PDFs generated during development  
**Why Remove:** Test data only. **Keep .gitkeep file to preserve directory structure**  
**Note:** Production will generate new PDFs, these are just development samples

### Development Tools (Keep but hide in production)
```
port-forwarder.js
```
**Used For:** Cloudflare tunnel port forwarding during development  
**Action:** Keep for development, but ensure it doesn't run in production

---

## üóëÔ∏è Category 2: Completely Unused Files (Safe to Delete Immediately)

These files are not referenced anywhere in the codebase and can be deleted without any impact.

### Temporary Office Lock Files
```
~$nverge Breakdown 2.docx
~$Online Enrollment Check Listxlsx.xlsx
~$w to Migrate to Production.docx
```
**Why Unused:** Temporary lock files created by Office, automatically deleted when files close

### Old CSS Backup Files
```
EnrollmentForm_3fdee1c.css
EnrollmentForm_backup.css
EnrollmentForm_early.css
EnrollmentForm_first.css
EnrollmentForm_March13.css
```
**Why Unused:** Old backup versions. Current active file: `frontend/src/components/EnrollmentForm.css`

### Duplicate Component Files (Wrong Location)
```
PaymentPage.css
PaymentPage.jsx
```
**Why Unused:** Duplicates in wrong location. Active files: `frontend/src/components/PaymentPage.jsx` and `.css`

### Documentation/Planning Files
```
Addon Descriptions.xlsx
Amounts Mapping.xlsx
Converge Breakdown 2.docx
Converge Breakdown.docx
Converge Checkout Lightbox Integration Instructions.docx
Currently Active Credit Card Processing Files.docx
Field Mapping.xlsx
How to Migrate to Production.docx
Online Enrollment Check Listxlsx.xlsx
Screenshots.docx
To integrate the Tokenizer API into your React website application with a frontend and backend.docx
tokenizer.txt
```
**Why Unused:** Planning/reference documents, not code. Information captured in actual documentation files.

### Misplaced SQL Files
```
frontend/src/contexts/new.sql
frontend/src/contexts/old.sql
```
**Why Unused:** Reference files in wrong location (frontend instead of backend), not imported anywhere

### Invalid/Broken Files
```
frontend/src/utils/invalid optimizedPdfGenerator.js
```
**Why Unused:** Filename indicates it's invalid/broken, not imported anywhere

### Old Static Log Files
```
backend/logs/all.log
backend/logs/error.log
```
**Why Unused:** Old static logs from previous logging system. New system uses daily rotating logs like `application-2025-09-30.log`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Files to Keep (Don't Remove)

- `ERROR_NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` - Error system docs
- `LOGGING_SYSTEM.md` - Logging system docs
- `backend/EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Email configuration docs

## ‚úÖ After Cleanup Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Test the application still works after cleanup

3. ‚úÖ Verify no import errors in console
4. ‚úÖ Check that tests still pass (if you have tests)
5. ‚úÖ Commit changes to git
6. ‚úÖ Create a backup before deploying to production

## üìù Notes

- The cleanup removes ~100MB+ of unnecessary files
- All removed files are either duplicates, backups, or development artifacts
- None of the removed files are referenced in the active codebase
- Keep the `.gitkeep` files in empty directories
- You can always recover files from git history if needed
